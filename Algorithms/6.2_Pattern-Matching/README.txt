Implementation of Algorithm 6.2
Author: Ryan McIntyre

Input is given in the command line as two binary strings.

sample call
	python match.py 1011001 00101001110110101100101010

Output is True if the second input contains a substring
matching the entire first input, and False otherwise. In
the case of a True return, the index of the first character
of a matching substring is returned as well.
