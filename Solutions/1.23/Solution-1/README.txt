This implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm has been tested with Python 2.7

The program can be instantiated by running:

python galeshapley.py data.txt

where data.txt is the data file to be used to create the stable marriages.

The first half of the file is the boy's preferences, the second half of the file is for the girls' suitor preferences.
