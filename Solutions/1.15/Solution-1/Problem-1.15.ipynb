    "There is a straightforward loop invariant: $a+b=x+y$. For the basis case, clearly this is true before the first iteration, as $a=x$ and $b=y$. So we need only show that $a_{i+1}+b_{i+1}=a_i+b_i$. First, consider the case where $a_i<b_i$. Then $a_{i+1}+b_{i+1}=(2a_i)+(b_i-a_i)=a_i+b_i$. Otherwise, $a_i\\ge b_i$, so $a_{i+1}+b_{i+1}=(a_i-b_i)+(2b_i)=a_i+b_i$. So transitivity guarantees that this loop invariant holds.\n",

Otherwise, $a_i\\ge b_i$, so $a_{i+1}=a_i-b_i\\ge a_i-a_i=0$. In either case, the invariant holds inductively. Note that a nearly identical proof shows that $b>0$ is an invariant as well.\n",

    "The second invariant provides insight pertaining to termination. The loop continues \"while $a>0$\"; we know that $a$ cannot be negative. Therefore, it only terminates when $a=0$. Moreover, given the first loop invariant ($a+b=x+y$), we now know that whenever the algorithm terminates, $0+b=x+y$. In other words, $b$ is the sum of $x$ and $y$. This provides motivation for an updated algorithm, as well. We know that if there is an output, the output value of $a$ will be 0, so why return it at all?"

    "Immediately, we can make some observations. First, the iteration limit was never reached here; every input that didn't terminate revealed a cycle, so these are actually inputs that never terminate. Second, and more importantly, every output is even. Let's try to prove that this is true in general, and not just in this particular sample of inputs.\n",

    "We also introduce yet another loop invariant: $a$ and $b$ are both mutiples of $g=\\gcd(x,y)$ (the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$). The basis case is straightforward; $g$ divides both $x$ and $y$ evenly by definition, and prior to the first iteration $a=x$ and $b=y$, so obviously $g$ divides $a_0$ and $b_0$. Assume that $g$ divides $a_i$ and $b_i$. Then, clearly, $g$ also divides all of the following: $2a_i$, $2b_i$, $a_i-b_i$, and $b_i-a_i$. We've shown the basis case and induction of this invariant, so it holds. It should also be noted that for any two positive integers $x$ and $y$, $\\gcd(x,y)$ is also a positive integer by definition, so  we've guaranteed that $a$ and $b$ remain positive integers.\n",

We aim to show that the algorithm terminates if and only if $\\frac{x+y}{\\gcd(x,y)}$ is a power of 2. Obviously, $a$ and $b$ meet the conditions we wish to impose on $x$ and $y$ just prior to termination. Therefore, it is enough to show simply that $\\frac{a+b}{\\gcd(a,b)}$ is a power of 2 if and only if $\\frac{a'+b'}{\\gcd(a',b')}$ is a power of 2 (where $a'$ and $b'$ are the values in the iteration following $a$ and $b$).\n",

By definition, $h\\ge1$. If $h=1$, we're done; $g'=g$ and $a'+b'=a+b$, so $\\frac{a+b}{g}$ did not change and is still a power of 2. So assume $h>1$. $h$ divides $t-s$ by definition. So if $h$ divides $s$, then $g$ also divides $t$ (since $t=(t-s)+s$) so $\\gcd(s,t)\\ge h$, a contradiction; we know $h$ cannot divide $s$. So $h$ divides $2s$ without dividing $s$, which implies that $h$ must be even. Given that $h$ is even and $h$ divides $2s$, we know that $\\frac{h}{2}$ divides $s$. Obviously $\\frac{h}{2}$ divides $t-s$, as $h$ divides $t-s$. Therefore, $\\frac{h}{2}$ also divides $t$. $\\frac{h}{2}$ is a common factor of $s$ and $t$, so $\\frac{h}{2}\\le\\gcd(s,t)=1$. In other words, $h\\le2$. We already knew that $h$ is an even number $>1$, so $h$ must be 2. $g'=2g$, so if $\\frac{a+b}{g}=2^n$, then $\\frac{a'+b'}{g'}=2^{n-1}$. Moreover, since $a\\neq b$ (and since $a\\neq0\\neq b$), $g<\\frac{a+b}{2}$, so $\\frac{a+b}{g}>2$; this, combined with our assumption that it is a power of 2, grants that $\\frac{a+b}{g}=2^n$ for some integer $n>1$.
